The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive clone of the AirBnb site. it involves a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.


Project Goals:
    User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
    Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
    Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
    Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
    Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


Tech Stack:
    HTML, CSS, Reactjs
    Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
    Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
    PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
    GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
    Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
    Redis: Used for caching and session management.
    Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
    CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


UI/UX Design Planning:

Design Goals
- Clean, modern, and intuitive interface
- Easy navigation between listings and checkout
- Consistent branding and styles
- Responsive design (desktop & mobile)

Key Features:
    Property listing display
    Property details with images & pricing
    Simple checkout system

Primary Pages:

    Property Listing: Displays all available properties with images, price, and location |
    Listing Details: Detailed view of a selected property (description, reviews, amenities) |
    Checkout: Simple booking and payment flow for selected property |

Why User-Friendly Design Matters:
    In a booking system, a clear and easy-to-use design improves trust, reduces errors, and makes the booking experience faster and more enjoyable, leading to higher user satisfaction.

    Scrum Master: Facilitates agile processes, removes blockers, organizes meetings     


UI Component Patterns:

Planned components:
Navbar: Navigation across pages (logo, links, profile)
Property Card: Displays image, title, price, and location of a property
Footer: Contains links, copyright, and social




Database Design:

Entities:
    User:
        fields: Name, Id, payment method.
        Relationship: A user may be an owner of a property, or a renter. A user can can book or own 1 or more properties. A user may also leave a review on a property

    Property:
        Fields: location, name, booking status and owner
        Relationship: A property can be booked or owned by only 1 person. It may also have one or more reviews

    Reviews:
        Fields: Id, date, content
        Relationship: 1 or more reviews may belong to a property 
    
    Payments:
        Fields: TransactionID, date, amount, UserID
        Relationship: 1 or more payments  may be made by the user to the owner concerting one or more properties. The owner may recieve one pre more payments from a user concerning one or more properties. 

    Bookings:
        Fields: ID, Status, propertyID, Owner, User
        Relationship: A user may book a property.


Feature Breakdown:

    User Authentication
        Features: This feature manages users. From Registration, authenticationa and overall management of user profiles. 

    Property Management

        Features: This Feature manages properties From Creation, update, retrieval, and deletion of property listings.

    Booking System

        Features: This section manages bookings. It involves Making, updating, and managing  bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

    Payment Processing

        Features: This section is responsible for handling payment transactions related to bookings.

    Review System

        Features: This section handles user reviews. It allows users to post and manage reviews for properties.


API Security:
The following measures will be put in place to ensure users can use the application safely:

    Strong Authentication and Authorization:

    Implement robust mechanisms like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or API keys to verify user and application identities. Use granular access controls (e.g., role-based access control, scopes, claims) to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only access necessary resources.

    Data Encryption:

    Enforce TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.2 or higher for all API communications to encrypt data in transit, protecting sensitive information from interception. Consider using Mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced client and server authentication.

    Input Validation and Sanitization:

    Validate and sanitize all incoming data on the server side to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and ensure data integrity. Use whitelisting and schema validation where appropriate.

    Rate Limiting and Throttling:

    Implement rate limits per user or IP address to prevent brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and API abuse by restricting the number of requests within a given timeframe.

    API Gateways:

    Utilize API gateways to centralize security controls, enforce policies, manage traffic, and provide a single point of entry for APIs, enhancing overall security posture.


CICD Pipelines:
    A CI/CD pipeline is an automated software development workflow that streamlines the process of writing, testing, and deploying code, making releases faster, more reliable, and more consistent. It combines Continuous Integration (CI), where code changes are frequently merged into a shared repository and automatically tested to catch issues early, with Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD), which automates the delivery of code to staging and production environments after successful testing.

    Tools used for this endeavor include:
        Github actions
        Docker
